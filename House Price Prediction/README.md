*I created an article on Medium. Check on the link: https://medium.com/@moniquecardoso123/house-price-prediction-advanced-regression-techniques-ba946409551c*

## Objective

The aim of this project was to predict house prices using the Kaggle dataset "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques." As a self-taught data science enthusiast, I sought to demonstrate my skills in exploratory analytics, feature engineering, and machine learning models.

## Approach and Results

- Explored the dataset, addressing missing values by substituting them with -1 to indicate unavailable information.
- Conducted feature engineering to enhance model performance by creatively manipulating variables.
- Utilized three machine learning models: Linear Regression, Tree Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- Evaluated the models using Absolute Error and Squared Error metrics, discovering that Linear Regression excelled with the lowest mean squared error.
- Validated the Linear Regression model through visualization, highlighting its accuracy in predicting house prices.
- Submitted the predictions to Kaggle and achieved an impressive score of 0.25.
