Welcome to my Data Science Projects Repository! It contains a collection of my Data Science projects in order to show my skills and expertise in the field. Each project is a demonstration of different aspects of Data Analysis, Visualization, Machine Learning and Cloud Computing.

## Projects

1. [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/moniquecardoso25/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/House%20Price%20Prediction)

**Description:** This project is a captivating journey of a self-taught data science enthusiast who tackled the challenge of predicting house prices using the Kaggle dataset "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques." The goal was to showcase skills in exploratory analytics, feature engineering, and machine learning models.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Linear Regression, Tree Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Data Visualization

**Results:**
- Explored dataset and handled missing values by substituting with -1.
- Conducted creative feature engineering to enhance model performance.
- Utilized three machine learning models, with Linear Regression achieving the lowest mean squared error.
- Validated the Linear Regression model through visualization, confirming its accuracy.
- Achieved an impressive Kaggle score of 0.25 for house price predictions.
