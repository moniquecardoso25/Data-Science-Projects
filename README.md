Welcome to my Data Science Projects Repository! It contains a collection of my Data Science projects in order to show my skills and expertise in the field. Each project is a demonstration of different aspects of Data Analysis, Visualization, Machine Learning and Cloud Computing.

## Projects

1. [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/moniquecardoso25/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/House%20Price%20Prediction)

**Description:** This project is a captivating journey of a self-taught data science enthusiast who tackled the challenge of predicting house prices using the Kaggle dataset "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques." The goal was to showcase skills in exploratory analytics, feature engineering, and machine learning models.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Linear Regression, Tree Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Data Visualization

**Results:**
- Explored dataset and handled missing values by substituting with -1.
- Conducted creative feature engineering to enhance model performance.
- Utilized three machine learning models, with Linear Regression achieving the lowest mean squared error.
- Validated the Linear Regression model through visualization, confirming its accuracy.
- Achieved an impressive Kaggle score of 0.25 for house price predictions.

This project showcased the ability to independently tackle real-world data challenges and deliver valuable insights through exploratory analytics and feature engineering. The outcome solidified my understanding of evaluation methodologies and reinforced my passion for data science.

2. [Telecom Churn Prediction](https://github.com/moniquecardoso25/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Telecom%20Churn%20Prediction)


**Description:** The objective of this project is to predict customer churn in a telecom company. Customer Churn is the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company or discontinue their services. For that, develop a machine learning model that can predict customers who will leave the company.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing - Robust Scaler
- Feature Engineering
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest Regression, XGB Classifier
- Data Visualization
- Encoding Variables using LabelEncoder
- Evaluation and confusion matrix

**Results:**
- Understanding of the Business problem.
- Explored dataset through the graphics.
- Conducted feature engineering to improve the model performance.
- Utilized three machine learning models, in which Logistic Regression had the best performance related to others.
- Achieved 80% of Accuracy, the number of predicted Customer churns was 460.
- Conclusions and recommendations to the company about the analysis.

3. [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/moniquecardoso25/Data-Science-Projects/tree/69762c466d7eb2b88442b5fd763862cd6745d0ce/Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20Detection)

**Description:** The challenge is to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that the customers of credit card companies are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

**Technologies Used:**
