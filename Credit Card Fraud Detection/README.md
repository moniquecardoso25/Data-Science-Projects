# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

## Objective

The challenge is to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that the customers of credit card companies are not charged for items that they did not purchase. The dataset is available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

## Approach and Results

- Explored the dataset, separating inside the "Class" column the fraudulent and normal transaction.
- Employed feature engineering to solving imbalanced dataset and Robust Scaller 
- Utilized three machine learning models: Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, MLP Classifier.
- Evaluated model performance using Accuracy and Recall, with Logistic Regression achieving the highest accuracy of 99.96%.

## Tools Utilized
- Python
- Machine Learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, MLP Classifier
- Data Preprocessing 
- Feature Engineering 
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
- Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy and recall.

## Conclusion

The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 99.96%, while Random Forest achieved 99.92% and MLP 99.95%.
